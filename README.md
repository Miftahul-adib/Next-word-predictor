## Dataset:
The model is trained on 2 AI related paragraphs written by CHATGPT.


## Features

1)Tokenization of text data

2)Sequence padding for uniform input length

3)Model architecture with embedding layers and LSTM units

4)Training with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer

5)Evaluation using accuracy metrics

6)Next-word prediction functionality
